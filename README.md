# Airplane-Accident-Severity-Dashboard
This project analyzes aircraft accident data from 1990 to 2016 using the FAAâ€™s World Aircraft Accident Summary (WAAS) dataset. The dashboard reveals patterns related to accident severity, survivability, and injury rates, with data cleaning conducted in R and visualizations created in Tableau.
### Project Files
- Airplane Accident Severity Dashboard.png: Preview image of the final dashboard.
- CaseStudy_DataCleaning.R: R script for cleaning and preparing the raw accident data.
- R_CaseStudy(AirplaneAccidentSeverity).twb: Tableau workbook file for visualizing accident trends and patterns.
- world_aircraft_accident_summaryC.xlsx: Original dataset from FAA's WAAS.
- world_aircraft_accident_summary_cleaned.xlsx: Cleaned dataset generated by the R script.
### Setup and Usage
1. Data Preparation in R:
   - Open CaseStudy_DataCleaning.R in RStudio or any R environment.
   - Install necessary packages as prompted by the script.
   - Run the script to generate the cleaned dataset, world_aircraft_accident_summary_cleaned.xlsx.
2. Visualizations in Tableau:
   - Open R_CaseStudy(AirplaneAccidentSeverity).twb in Tableau.
   - Load the cleaned dataset to explore accident trends, survivability ratios, and injury analyses interactively.

### Dashboard
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- Total Accidents, Fatalities, and Injuries: Key summary metrics.
- Accident Trend Over Time: Yearly trend analysis of accidents.
- Accident Locations Map: Interactive map to view accident locations by specific years or all years.
- Top 10 Aircraft Models by Accidents: Breakdown of aircraft models with the highest accident counts.
- Survivability by Aircraft Model: Comparison of survivability rates across models.
- Total Aboard vs. Fatalities and Injuries: Analysis of casualties relative to the number of passengers aboard.
